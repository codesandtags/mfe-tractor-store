# Tractor Store

## Overview Tractor Store

[Tractor Models Inc](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/micro-frontends-in/9781617296871/), is an imaginary startup, manufactures high-quality tin toy models of popular tractor brands. Currently, they are in the process of building an e-commerce website: The Tractor Store. It allows tractor fans from all over the world to purchase their favorite models.

To cater to their audience as best as possible, they want to experiment and test different features and business models. The concepts they plan to validate are offering deep customization options, auctions for premium material models, regionally limited special editions, and booking private in-person demos in flagship stores in all major cities.

To achieve maximum flexibility in development, the company decided to build the software from scratch and not go with an off-the-shelf solution. The company wants to evaluate their ideas and features quickly. That is why they decided to go with the micro frontends architecture. Multiple teams can work in parallel, independently build new features, and validate ideas. They are starting with two teams.

Weâ€™ll set up the software project for both Team Decide and Team Inspire. Team Decide will create a product detail page for all tractors that displays the name and image of the model. Team Inspire will provide matching recommendations. In the first iteration, each team displays its content on a separate page from its own domain. They connect the pages via links. So we have a product page and a recommendation page for every model.
